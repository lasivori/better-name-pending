## TO-DO
Feature | Description |
--------|-------------|
In-Browser Gaming | I would love to add a way for certain games to be playable in browser, rather than completely relying on downloading. |
Sorting | I need to work on the sorting features for exploring games, as well as for the forums. |
Images | Soon enough, you can upload your own images to be used as the 'main' and 'additional' images in game pages. Might also add a way to use images in forums. |
Actual Profile Settings | I need to impliment options such as changing your password, email, profile image, etc. And maybe also add things such as 'themes' so you can change from 'light-mode' to 'dark-mode', etc. |
